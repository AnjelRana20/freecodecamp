                <p>
                    After passing the high-school and leaving the idea of becoming a footballer.I stumble upon the idea of
                    doing
                    something in the tech industry. Being belong from the commerce background it was not hard to think to
                    get into
                    tech line but I have heard a lot of stories where people are changing their profession. What else if not
                    story
                    to shape how a person thinks or acts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Write now I am focusing on improving the habit and work ethic.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For me learning and understanding the world has become different, now i see studying differently.For
                    examples: Now a days i rather focus on understanding than craming it and making notes out of it helps me
                    understanding the concept in my own term.
                </p>
                <h2>Things I want to learn</h2>
                <p>My main focus right now is to become a software developer.</p>
                <p>I want to improve myself in terms of designing & building, stragtegies, tech and science and intelluctual
                    stuffs.

                <p>
                    Grabbing the people the people's attention is difficult but once understand we can easily predict their
                    moves.
                    Therefore understanding how the design, animation, games development, technincal know-how of hardware,
                    audio, sales, marketing, finance and hacking really helps.

                </header> 
                <p> The biggest problem, I am facing is not able to be consistent which is huge deal when it comes to about the 
                    achieving the feat I have mentioned above.
                    Phone is the biggest distraction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am grateful for having a laptop right now. But I wanted to replace it due its slow processing.
                </p>
                <p>
                   A heck ton of debt on us which is not a good sign at all.

                <p>I want to do freelancing in the intial periods to gain knowledge and experience of tech industry but it will 
                    totally depend on my success of  startup.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But will work for people whom I admire the most.
                </p>
                <p>
                     From now on, I will try to make a good habit i.e with first waking up around 6 which will create a momentum.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Try to give 6-7 hours a day on learning 2-3 on practicing it everyday. 
                </p>

                    <p>You know Anjel the condition, you in and better leave it right now. Motivation come and go but the habit
                        that you will create stays forever. Try study 9-10 hours a day tech, design, communication etc.
                        But try to be consistent.
                        Watch anime, read books, watch movies because that helps in making your imagination stronger.
